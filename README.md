# Introduction to Machine Learning

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks covering various machine learning topics. Whether you're new to machine learning or looking to expand your knowledge, these notebooks provide hands-on examples and explanations to help you understand different concepts and algorithms.

## Notebooks

1. **[Classification_using_KNN.ipynb](Classification_using_KNN.ipynb)**  
   Explore the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification tasks. Learn how to implement KNN and visualize its decision boundaries.

2. **[Linear_Regression.ipynb](Linear_Regression.ipynb)**  
   Dive into linear regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm for predicting continuous values. Understand how to fit a linear model to data and interpret the results.

3. **[Machine_Learning_Hands_on_1.ipynb](Machine_Learning_Hands_on_1.ipynb)**  
   Get hands-on experience with various machine learning techniques. This notebook covers a range of topics, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

4. **[Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb](Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb)**  
   Extend your understanding of linear regression to handle multiple input features. Explore how to build and evaluate multiple linear regression models.

5. **[Non_Linear_Regression.ipynb](Non_Linear_Regression.ipynb)**  
   Delve into non-linear regression, where the relationship between input and output variables is not linear. Learn about different non-linear regression techniques and their applications.

6. **[Polynomial_Regression.ipynb](Polynomial_Regression.ipynb)**  
   Discover polynomial regression, a type of regression analysis that models the relationship between the independent and dependent variables as an nth-degree polynomial. Understand how to fit polynomial curves to data.
