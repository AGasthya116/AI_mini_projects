    Discover DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), a density-based clustering algorithm used for clustering tasks. Learn how DBSCAN works and its advantages over other clustering algorithms.

13. **[Recommendation Systems - Content-based Filtering](12_Recommendation_Systems.ipynb)**  
    Explore content-based recommendation systems, which recommend items to users based on the characteristics of the items and the user's preferences.

14. **[Recommendation Systems - Collaborative Filtering](13_Collaborative_Filtering.ipynb)**  
    Dive into collaborative filtering recommendation systems, which make recommendations based on the preferences and behavior of similar users.
